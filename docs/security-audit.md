# Security Audit Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security validation system implemented for the dotfiles repository as part of TEST-004 Security Validation. The system ensures zero secret exposure and maintains security best practices throughout the development lifecycle.

## Security Validation Components

### 1. Multi-Tool Secret Scanning

**Location**: `tests/security/scan-secrets.sh`

Our secret scanning system uses comprehensive built-in patterns to detect potential secrets:

- **Private Keys**: RSA, DSA, EC, OpenSSH, PGP private keys
- **API Keys**: Generic and service-specific API keys
- **Passwords**: Hardcoded password patterns
- **Cloud Credentials**: AWS, GitHub, GitLab, Docker credentials
- **Database Credentials**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB credentials
- **High-Entropy Strings**: Base64 and hexadecimal patterns

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic scan
./tests/security/scan-secrets.sh

# Verbose output
./tests/security/scan-secrets.sh --verbose

# Report-only mode (CI-friendly)
./tests/security/scan-secrets.sh --report-only
```

### 2. File Permission Validation

**Location**: `tests/security/check-permissions.sh`

Validates file permissions according to security best practices:

- **644** for configuration files (readable, not executable)
- **755** for scripts (executable by all, writable by owner only)
- **600** for sensitive files (readable by owner only)
- **700** for sensitive directories (accessible by owner only)
- **No world-writable files** (security risk)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Check permissions
./tests/security/check-permissions.sh

# Automatically fix issues
./tests/security/check-permissions.sh --fix

# Verbose output
./tests/security/check-permissions.sh --verbose
```

### 3. Git History Security Analysis

**Location**: `tests/security/git-history-scan.sh`

Scans git history for potential security issues:

- **Commit Messages**: Suspicious patterns indicating secret exposure
- **Sensitive File Patterns**: Files that should never be in git
- **Branch/Tag Analysis**: Suspicious naming patterns
- **Historical Content**: Deep scanning of file content (optional)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Basic history scan
./tests/security/git-history-scan.sh

# Deep content analysis
./tests/security/git-history-scan.sh --deep

# Scan since specific date
./tests/security/git-history-scan.sh --since 2023-01-01
```

### 4. Template Security Testing

**Location**: `tests/security/template-security-test.sh`

Validates template system security:

- **Template Injection**: Tests for code injection vulnerabilities
- **Secret Exposure**: Ensures templates don't leak secrets
- **Variable Handling**: Validates safe variable substitution
- **Error Handling**: Checks for information disclosure in errors
- **File Inclusion**: Tests for path traversal vulnerabilities

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full security test suite
./tests/security/template-security-test.sh

# Basic validation only
./tests/security/template-security-test.sh --fast

# Verbose output
./tests/security/template-security-test.sh --verbose
```

## Configuration

### Whitelist Configuration

**Location**: `tests/security/config/whitelist.txt`

Contains patterns for approved exceptions to reduce false positives:

```text
# Example patterns (safe in dotfiles context)
example[_-]?password
test[_-]?key
sample[_-]?token

# Template variables (intentional placeholders)
\$\{.*\}
\{\{.*\}\}

# Documentation examples
password.*example
api.*key.*example
```

### Custom Secret Patterns

**Location**: `tests/security/config/patterns.yaml`

Organization-specific secret detection patterns:

```yaml
patterns:
  - name: "Private SSH Keys"
    regex: "-----BEGIN (RSA|DSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY-----"
    severity: "critical"
    description: "SSH private keys should never be committed"
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**Location**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`

Automated security validation includes:

- **Secret Scanning**: Runs on every push and PR
- **Permission Checking**: Validates file permissions
- **Git History Analysis**: Scans for historical exposure
- **Template Security**: Tests template system safety
- **Security Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports

**Triggers:**
- Push to main/master/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Daily scheduled runs (2 AM UTC)
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Pre-commit Hooks

**Location**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

Prevents secrets from being committed:

- **Local Security Scripts**: Runs our custom scanners
- **detect-secrets**: Yelp's secret detection tool
- **shellcheck**: Shell script security analysis
- **File Content Checks**: Hardcoded secret detection
- **Sensitive File Detection**: Prevents key files from being committed

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Security Policies

### File Permission Policy

| File Type | Permission | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Configuration files | 644 | Readable by owner/group, not executable |
| Scripts | 755 | Executable by all, writable by owner only |
| Sensitive files | 600 | Readable by owner only |
| SSH private keys | 600 | Owner read/write only |
| SSH directories | 700 | Owner access only |

### Secret Management Policy

1. **Never commit secrets** to any branch
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Implement template variables** (${SECRET_NAME}) instead of hardcoded values
4. **Rotate exposed credentials** immediately
5. **Use proper .gitignore patterns** for sensitive files

## Incident Response

### When Secrets Are Detected

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Stop the commit/push process
   - Identify the type and scope of secret exposure
   - Remove secrets from files immediately

2. **Assessment:**
   - Determine if secrets were pushed to remote repositories
   - Check if secrets are in git history
   - Evaluate potential exposure risk

3. **Remediation:**
   - Rotate exposed credentials immediately
   - Clean git history if necessary (using BFG Repo-Cleaner or git-filter-branch)
   - Update security baselines and whitelists
   - Document the incident

4. **Prevention:**
   - Review and strengthen pre-commit hooks
   - Provide additional security training
   - Update detection patterns if necessary

### Tools for Secret Removal

- **BFG Repo-Cleaner**: Fast alternative to git-filter-branch
- **git-filter-branch**: Built-in git tool for rewriting history
- **git-secrets**: Prevents secrets from being committed
- **git-crypt**: Transparent file encryption in git

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Security Reports

Generated automatically by security scans:

- **Markdown Reports**: Human-readable security findings
- **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable data for automation
- **CI/CD Summaries**: Integrated with GitHub Actions

### Metrics Tracked

- Number of secret scan violations
- File permission issues
- Git history security findings
- Template security vulnerabilities
- Pre-commit hook effectiveness

### Alerts
