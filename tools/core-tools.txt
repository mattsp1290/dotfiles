# Core Cross-Platform Development Tools
# These tools are essential for most development workflows and work consistently across macOS and Linux

# Version Management System
asdf                    # Multi-language version manager - replaces nvm, pyenv, rbenv, etc.

# Modern CLI Tools (Enhanced replacements for standard tools)
bat                     # Better 'cat' with syntax highlighting and git integration
exa                     # Modern replacement for 'ls' with colors and icons
fd                      # Better 'find' - simple, fast, and user-friendly
ripgrep                 # Ultra-fast text search (rg) - better grep
fzf                     # Fuzzy finder for command line and vim
jq                      # JSON processor - parse and manipulate JSON
yq                      # YAML processor - like jq but for YAML

# Git Tools
git-delta               # Enhanced git diff with better syntax highlighting
gh                      # GitHub CLI for repository management
gitleaks                # Detect and prevent secrets in git repos

# Container and Orchestration
docker                  # Container runtime (where not already installed)
docker-compose          # Multi-container Docker applications
kubectl                 # Kubernetes command-line interface
helm                    # Kubernetes package manager
k9s                     # Terminal UI for Kubernetes clusters

# Network and Debugging
httpie                  # User-friendly HTTP client
curlie                  # Frontend to curl with httpie-like syntax

# Essential Utilities
direnv                  # Environment variable manager per directory
stow                    # Symlink farm manager (if not already installed)
tree                    # Display directory structure
ncdu                    # NCurses disk usage analyzer

# Security Tools
age                     # Modern encryption tool (successor to GPG for files)
sops                    # Secrets management for config files
